                "i was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. i signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shorty
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                time of my life.Since completing the course,I've successfully
                switched careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup."
